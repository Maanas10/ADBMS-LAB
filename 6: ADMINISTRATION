1.      Write a MongoDB query to create a user “CUSTOMER1” and grant the read role in the INVOICE database.

> use admin
switched to db admin


> db.createUser({user: "Customer1",pwd:"Maanas",roles: [{ role: "read", db: "INVOICE" },]})
Successfully added user: {
	"user" : "Customer1",
	"roles" : [
		{
			"role" : "read",
			"db" : "INVOICE"
		}
	]
}


mongo -u Customer1 -p Maanas

        Enable MongoDB's free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display
        metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

        The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible to you
        and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
        improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

        To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()
        To permanently disable this reminder, run the following command: db.disableFreeMonitoring()

2.      Write a MongoDB query to create the backup for the INVOICE database.

3.      Write a MongoDB query to restore a particular database or a collection.
